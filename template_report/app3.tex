\chapter{Typography and grammar}\label{app:typo}
Some errors crop up time and again, and a few of the commonest ---
mostly relating to use of \LaTeX\ --- are mentioned in the body of this
template. Some others are given here, aiming to help you avoid them.
\par
Layout errors include starting a sentence with a symbol, or leaving a
single symbol that ends a sentence hanging alone on a line. Related to
this are \Quote{widows} and \Quote{orphans} \cite{WO}. Can you spot any
in this template?
\par
Grammar --- illiteracy makes good mathematical work look like rubbish.
Of course, everyone makes mistakes, but a final version with many small
errors in fact signals \Quote{I am ignorant and I just don't care}.
Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the wisdom of the great goddess
Truss \cite{ESL}.
\par
Apart from spelling blunders, the top five usual suspects in recent
project reports are (in random order) ---\begin{itemize}
\item \Quote{sentences} with no verb;
\item mis-use of apostrophes;
\item mis- or non-use of hyphens;
\item writing \Quote{comprises of};
\item unpunctuated displayed equations.
\end{itemize}
A tip for proof-reading --- a friend or relative may spot things you've
become blind to. And remember in practise their are a massive number of
errors in grammer and stile, and so fourth its only to easy to make that
you're spell checker on it's own wont find (14 in this sentence).
