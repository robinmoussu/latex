\chapter{Introduction}
%% Introduire la problématique, les objectifs et l¿articulation du pré-rapport (2¿3
%% paragraphes)

My internship have been done in \smu, a start-up specialized in facial
recognition, from June \nth{15} to September \nth{15}. My tutor was Olivier
Kilh, a researcher in facial recognition. During my internship, I had many
contact why Steven Durand, the CTO, and Loic Lecerf, the CEO. I have worked whis
Gabriel Mattos Langeloh and Maude Premillieu, two other interns.

\smu{} is a start-up specialized in video recognition, especialy facial
recognition. His employees have developped a library that is able to make
real-time facial analisys. My goal during my internship was to create a
software. This one will be installed on \smu's client hardware (\linux, \win{}
or \android), then it will grab a video, and send the stream to \smu's server.
Gabriel has developped the server side of that project, and Maud the web
interface were the client can manage their subscriptions.

First I will present \smu{} and its employees. Then I will introduce the goal of
my intership, and the choises I have made. Next, I will describe the
methodology I have used during my intership. Afterward I will present the
results of my work and finnaly conclude.

\section{The company}

\smu{} is a start up from Meylan whitch has create a library for facial
analysis. That solution is usable as a base that can be embeded is any device,
like drone, robots, interactives advertissements,…

\smu{} was found in February 2012 by Loïc Lecerf. He has a PhD in artificial
intelligence. The initial founding for his start-up came from the selling of
a website he had previously created.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4cm]{french-tech.jpg}
  \label{fig:frenchtech}
  \caption{French Tech's logo}.
\end{wrapfigure}

The firsts client of \smu{} are Netatmo (in domotic solution) and Photomaton (to
ensure conformity of official photos). After finding thoses customers, three new
members has been hired: Steven Durand (polytecthnicien), Olivier Kihl and John
Ruz Hernandez (doctors in artificial inteligence and image recognition). A new
office has been create in Paris. The revenue of \smu{} in 2014 was 225'000\euro.

In January 2015, \smu{} has participate in the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in
Las Vegas. That event has increase it popularity, and new clients have been
found, including SNCF. \smu{} was as well present at the \textbf{French Tech}
(an organization that promote the french start-up). Nowadays, \smu{} want to
make a fundrasing of 1 to 2 millions euros.

\section{The employees}

The organization chart is presented on the figure~\ref{fig:organigramme}.

\smu is a start-up of seven employees. Loïc Lecerf is the PDG and founder,
Matthieu Marquenet is the commercial director, and Jessica Lecerf is the
administrative director. For R\&D, the CTO is Steven Durand, and three
reserchers work under his orders: Oliver Kihl, Johf Ruiz Hernandez and
Enguerrand Quilliard. As soon as they will optain their foundraising, \smu{}
will hire new permanents.

During this summer, 7 interns has worked in \smu. Amélie Fondevilla, Adrien
Saumureau, Baptiste Josi, Sara Akaoka Bdassi and Sébastien Detroyat have work on
specific project. Gabriel Mattos Langeloh, Maude Premillieu and myself have work
on the \claude{} project.

\section{The \claude{} project}

I have worked together whith Gabriel and Maud, two others interns. Our goal was
to grab videos from customers' cameras, and to analyse them on \smu's server
inside the cloud. At \smu, we were the \claude{} department (it's a pun with
\textit{cloud computing} with a big french accent $:$-$)$ ). During our
intership, we worked in the same office, so we were able to exchange a lot.

Even if Oliver Kilh was my tutor, in facts it was Steven Durand and Loïc Lecerf
who suppervise me, as well as the others interns of the \claude{} project.

My initial goal was to create a software that can stream a video from all type of
devices to the servers of \smu, where it will be analysed. To be more specific,
I have to support all type of webcam, on \linux, \win{} and \mac, smartphones
(\android, \ios), and ip cameras.

Gabriel goal was to create the softwares used on the server. Thoses sofwares
have to receive the video stream, and analyse them using the library developped
by \smu.

Maud has created the web interface. That website is the place where customer can
access to the results of their analysis and where they can administrate their
cameras (the clients have to pay a subscription for all their camera, and the
type of analysis they have chosen).

\section{Technologics choises}

Our goal (Gabriel, Maud and me) was to select the appropriate technology for
what we have to do. To be more specific:
\begin{itemize}
\item How to capture the images
\item How to encode them
\item How to send them to \smu{} server.
\end{itemize}

And furthurmore
\begin{itemize}
\item How to etablish connection between clients' software and \smu{} servers
\end{itemize}

Our first task was to learn how video are streamed in general. That part is
explain in details later (in the part~\ref{chap:Methodology}). The objective
was to found witch protocols are used for grapping encode and send image, and
libraries that can do it. XXXX

Our second goal was to define how our sofware will exchange informations. Since
clients machine, and \smu{} server are all links to internet, we have choose to
use http request. We have defined all the message we can send, and their
structure. **** exemple annexe ou partie 3

\section{Plateforms}

As I said, my goal was to write a software that could be run virtualy
everywhere. To be more specific, my initial targets were \linux{} (on PC, and
embedded devices like \rpi or \bbb), \win, \android, \mac{} and \ios. It was a
bit too ambitious, so the last two were dropped.

All employees in \smu work on ubuntu (a \linux distribution), so I have first
developped my solution for linux, keeping in mind that I will have to port it
after, so I never use plateform specific stuff. Then I port it to linux arm (I
have test it on \rpi and \bbb). After that, I try to create a \android
application, and finnaly for \win.

I was requested to write my software in \cpp. As a consequence of using native
language, my build system has to be able to create executable for all
plateforms. I have choose to use \cmake{} as build system, since \cmake{} was
already use in the company.

\section{Synthesis}

Since I have to support a very heterogeneous set a plateform, I had to be very
generic.

The main complicated part was to make tradeoff between performance required for
video encoding and the available bandwith. To lower the required bandwith, we
can use a better compression algorithm, however better algorithm mean highter
compression time, so worst lattency, and higher cpu usage. On slow CPU hardware
(smartphones and embedded devices like \rpi{} and \bbb{}) it was a real
challenge to found the right algorithm.

The results of the analisys of our needs for the \claude{} project have lead to
the sofware organization presented on figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. That figure
is exclacted from the documentation Gabriel has wrote. To be more clear, what I
call http gateway is the \textit{serveur HTTP}. The \textit{source} is anything
with a webcam (a pc, an embeded device, or a smartphone).

My contribution on the project was the source, and the specification of the
communications between HTTP gateway and streaming and analysis server. Gabriel
have worked on the video \& analisys server, and Maud on the rest (her intership
was longer).

\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:Methodology}
%% Décrire votre méthodologie de travail pour la mise en ¿uvre de votre solution 

\section{Organisation}

During all my intership, I had two small meeting per week (called \textit{point
claude}) with Steven Durand and Loïc Lecerf. The others interns of the \claude{}
project (Maude and Gabriel) were also there. During thoses meeting, we presented
the work we had done since the last time, and then we decide what to do next.
Since none of the employees of \smu have look our code during our intership (as
least for the \claude{} project, it was their only way to know what we were
doing.

Our general methodology was to quicly have something that work somewhere, and
then improve it by small iteration to make it work everywhere in all conditions.
As a consequence, we first test something on our machine, then using multiple
machine in local network, and finaly on the cloud.


\section{Challenges}
\subsection{Technologies used}

Firstly, we (Gabriel and me) have together to find an appropriate technologie
for video streaming. We have conclude that \rtp{} is a good choise. That was
motivate because \rtp{} can be easily replaced by \rtsp{} that work in a similar
way, but with encryption. Furthurmore, it can be use in tandem with \rtcp, witch
carry informations on the stream (like framerate, lag, ¿)

Select the good protocole is of course not enough, so we have cross plateform
search implementation. \ffmpeg, his fork \avconv, \vlc{} and \gstreamer{} where
good quandidates. \vlc{} was quicly avoided, because it has too much code that
we do not need. It was nevertheless usefull for testing purpose. At the
beggining, we have used \ffmpeg/\avconv, but we finally found that \gstreamer{}
as better performance results.

Having the right protocole and the right implementation is still not enough. We
had to choose and encoding that fit our needs. What we have wanted was something
easy to encode, because the client program can run on small hardware, like \rpi,
\bbb{} and smartphones. It also have to be lightweight, because we cannot assume
the our client connection will be fast.

All our tests have been first made on LAN, so mjpeg was a very good quandidate.
It's just a sequence of \jpeg{} images, so it was realy, realy fast to encode,
even on small hardware. As a direct consequence, the delay was excellant,
however when we made read tests using a server somewhere on the cloud, the
amount of data needed for the transmission was too hight. So we had to choose
something else. We have tested \mpeg{} and \vpx, and the later was keept.

At this point we knew how to grab images, encode them, and send them to a
server. It's cool, but we need something to ask the permission the server. We
choose to simply use http request. \curl{} was a good initial choise, since it
is a very powerfull library. However, in the optique of minimizing dependances,
I finally use \happyhttp.

\subsection{Minimize the dependency}

One of my objective was to create a sofware whose source code is really
portable. So, my tutor ask me to minimize the number of dependencies, and their
complexities.

For prototyping, I have used some python and shell scripts. Since we cannot
assume that they are installed on our client machine, my tutor ask me to use
native code (to be more specific \cpp). Binary package are not transfereable
across operating system and cpu, I had to generate binaries for all targets.

In July, I have wrote a software that did the work, but with too many
dependencies. I had used boost for arguments and \json{} parsing, and curl for http
request. I have also used gstreamer for video (grab image, compress using \vpx{}
and send using \rtp/\rtcp) but it was a hard dependency.

Removing boost and curl was too complicated, so I re-write my software, but much
faster than the first time, since I already know what I want to do, and how to
do it.

To replace boost, I have wrote a minimal \json{} parser (for the sub-part of
\json{} we use for the communication between the client and the http gateway).
To parse the arguments provided to the program, I have made a manual read of
the arguments on \verb+argv+. Of course my own code have less possibilities than
boost, but it was less complex, and that was what I was asked for.

With the similar optique, I have replaced \libcurl{} by \happyhttp. That second
library is only one small source file, so it is easier to embed it. Furthurmore
the employees of \smu{} were already using it. With some take back, I think that
using \libcurl{} in the first place was a good idea, since it had help me to
understant the errors easily when we was creating the http protocol between the
client software and the http gateway.

However my main dependency was etheir to \gstreamer{} of to \ffmpeg/\avconv. Since
they are both as complex, it was not an arguments in favor of one or another.
-> more complicated remaining dependancy in my code.

In the optique of being as simple as possible for the user to test that sofware,
I had to design my sofware in a way it could be used without installation.
(\fpm{} was initialy used to create real .deb package)

\section{Solving problems}

During my intership, I have wasted some time because at some point I was stuck,
and I had not enough method to find the right solution in a short time. Making
pair-programming was a good idea, but we did not use it enough for my taste.

Sometime, when I was stuck, I left my desk, to help someone else, and when I
came back that person help me back. In general, that save us both a lot of time,
because, it help us to take a more global view on what we were doing. The key
point of that is that explaining to someone else our problem help us to
formalize it.

\chapter{Results}

\section{Technologies used}

\subsection{Build system}

I have developped a build system based on \cmake. It was choosen because it is
cross plateform (that was obviously required), and powerfull enough to fit my
need. I also wrote a small python script to call \cmake{} more easyly. I have
developped it when I was trying to make cross compilation. So in one command, I
build the whole program for all architecture. At the end, I used it just as an
helper.

XXX
cross-compillation
Our initial goal was to have a cross-plateform build system. In that ideal
scenario, when I want to create a new release of my software, I have

The build process for \linux, on intel and arm device or for \win{} is quite
similar (except some fiew \#ifdef), so the build system is the same (we use
\cmake). On \android{} however, The main has to be written in java. So, I have
used \jni{} to build my \cpp{} codebase and linked it to java. So I can share my
work also on that plateform.

\subsection{Grab image and send video}

\gstreamer{} pipeline
\ffmpeg/\avconv{} work similary.

\subsection{Android}

Android sofware has to be in java. Since my work was done in \cpp, I have use
\jni, that allow me to call \cpp code from java. I have also use tha \android{}
sdk and ndk as well as the gstreamer sdk. Using thoses software tools as allow
me to easily start to port my software. However, some differences in the usage
of \gstreamer{} on \android{} have made the developpement more difficult, and I
had not enough time to finish it.

\section{Conclusion}

To sum up, at the end of my intership, I have wrote a sofware that can compile
and run on multiple plateforms~: \linux{} (both intel and arm) and \win. A lots
of work have also be done for \android, but not everything have been finished.
My program is able to ask the htpp gateway the autorization to start the stream.
Then it grab images, compress them using \vpx{} encoding, and send them using a
\rtp{}/\rtcp{} stream. All that is done using a gstreamer backend. The program I
wrote still need more tuning to be faster, especially on embedded hardware.

\chapterimage{Pink_flowers.jpg} % Table of contents heading image
\chapter{Personnal conclusion}

To sum up, the keys points of my intership were:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item design a sofware architecture
\item define witch protocols will be used and how
\item create a robust build system
\item understand the link process
\item how to build for multiple target (\linux{} arm and intel, \win, \android)
\item try to have cross compilation
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The part that motivate me the most was designing the communication protocol.
When designing a protocol, we have to take care of making it both expressive and
easy to parse/understand. I found that the result is pretty clean, and it was a
good experience to work with Gabriel and Maud under the direction of Steven
Durand and Loïc Lecerf.

The major amount of work was the build process and its fine details. Building
for one architecture is realy easy, however when we want to support many more
system, it become more complicated. \cmake{} was realy usefull to simplify that
task. What was too complicated for me was cross-compiling with many dependencies
at the same time, using static link. Despite everything, I have learned a lot of
that process.

To summurize, that intership was really instructive, and I feel that I have a
finer understanding of the \cpp{} build process.
