\chapter{Introduction}
%% Introduire la problématique, les objectifs et l¿articulation du pré-rapport (2¿3
%% paragraphes)

My internship have been done in \smu, a start-up specialized in facial
recognition, from June \nth{15} to September \nth{15}. My tutor was Olivier
Kilh, a researcher in facial recognition. During my internship, I had many
contact why Steven Durand, the CTO, and Loic Lecerf, the CEO. I have worked whis
Gabriel Mattos Langeloh and Maude Premillieu, two other interns.

\smu{} is a start-up specialized in video recognition, especialy facial
recognition.

\smu{} has developped a library that is able to make real-time facial analisys.
My goal during my internship was to create a software. This one will be
installed on \smu's client hardware (\linux, \win{} or \android), then it will
grab a video, and send the stream to \smu's server. Gabriel has developped the
server side of that project, and Maud the web interface were the client can
manage their subscriptions.

\chapterimage{Raspberry_Pi_2.jpg}
\chapter{Goal of the internship}
%% Présenter de manière concise et intelligible par une personne non spécialiste du
%% domaine la problématique de votre stage et bien définir l¿existant :
%% (environ 5 pages)
%% le problème à résoudre
%% les objectifs précis attendus 
%% l¿état de l¿art des solutions existantes et des contraintes fi xées par 
%% l¿entreprise
%% votre solution motivée à partir de l¿analyse ci-dessus

My initial goal was to create a software that can stream a video from all type of
devices to the server of \smu, where it will be analysed. To be more specific,
it have to support all type of webcam, on \linux, \win{} and \mac, smartphones
(\android, \ios), and ip cameras.

I have worked together whith Gabriel and Maud, two others interns.

Gabriel goal was to create the server the receive the video stream, and launch
the analysis using the library developped by smu.

Maud has created the web interface. That website is the place where customer can
access to the results of their analysis and where they can administrate their
cameras (they have to pay a subscription for all their camera, and the type of
analysis they chose).

During our intership, we worked in the same office, so we were able to exchange
a lot. At \smu, we were the `claude` department (it's a pun with `cloud
computing` with a big french accent :) ).

\subsection{Plateforms}

As I said, my goal was to write a software that could be run virtualy
everywhere. To be more specific, my initial targets were \linux{} (on PC, and
embedded devices), \win, \android, \mac{} and \ios. It was a bit too ambitious, so
the two XXXderniersXXX were XXXabandonnés.

That sofware as to be written in \cpp, and as to be easy to use. As a
consequence of using native language, my build system has to be able to create
executable for all plateforms.

\subsection{Technologie used}

Our goal (Gabriel, Maud and me) was to select the appropriate technology for
what we have to do. More precisely:
\begin{itemize}
\item how to capture the images
\item how to encode them
\item how to send them
\item how to etablish connection between clients' software and \smu{} servers
\end{itemize}

Reciprocally, Gabriel has to receive the video stream and decode it.

\subsection{synthesis}

Since I have to support a very heterogeneous set a plateform, I had to be very
generic.
The main complicated part was to make tradeoff between performance required for
video encoding and the available bandwith. The better the compression was, the
highter time it took to compress the images. 
On slow CPU hardware (smartphones and embedded devices, like \rpi{} and \bbb{},
it was a real challenge to found the right algorithm.

\chapterimage{webcams.jpg}
\chapter{Methodology}
%% Décrire votre méthodologie de travail pour la mise en ¿uvre de votre solution 

Our general methodology was to quicly have something that work somewhere, and
then improve it to make it work everywhere in all conditions.

So, we first test something on our machine, then using multiple machine in our
office, and finnaly on the cloud.

\subsection{Technologies used}

Firstly, we (Gabriel and me) have together to find an appropriate technologie
for video streaming. We have conclude that \rtp{} is a good choise. That was
motivate because \rtp{} can be easily replaced by \rtsp{} that work in a similar
way, but with encryption. Furthurmore, it can be use in tandem with \rtcp, witch
carry informations on the stream (like framerate, lag, ¿)

Select the good protocole is of course not enough, so we have cross plateform
search implementation. \ffmpeg, his fork \avconv, \vlc{} and \gstreamer{} where good
quandidates. \vlc{} was quicly avoided, because it has too much code that we do not
need. It was nevertheless usefull for testing purpose. At the beggining, we have
used \ffmpeg/\avconv, but we finnally found that \gstreamer{} as better performance
results.

Having the right protocole and the right implementation is still not enough. We
had to choose and encoding that fit our needs. What we have wanted was something
easy to encode, because the client program can run on small hardware, like \rpi,
\bbb{} and smartphones. It also have to be lightweight, because we cannot assume
the our client connection will be fast.

All our tests have been first made on LAN, so mjpeg was a very good quandidate.
It's just a sequence of \jpeg{} images, so it was realy, realy fast to encode,
even on small hardware. As a direct consequence, the delay was excellant,
however when we made read tests using a server somewhere on the cloud, the
amount of data needed for the transmission was too hight. So we had to choose
something else. We have tested \mpeg{} and \vpx, and the later was keept.

At this point we knew how to grab images, encode them, and send them to a
server. It's cool, but we need something to ask the permission the server. We
choose to simply use http request. \curl{} was a good initial choise, since it is
a very powerfull library. However, in the optique of minimizing dependances, I
finnally use \happyhttp.

\subsection{Minimize the dependency}

One of my objective was to create a sofware that is really portable. So, my
tutor ask me to minimize the number of dependencies, and their complexities.

python ->, cannot assume it is installed on client machine -> use of native code
(c++).

boost -> considered too complex for my tutor, so I have remove it, and replace
the part I needed (parse json, read arguments from command line, ¿) by my own
code.

With the same optique, I have replaced libcurl by HappyHTTP. That second library
is only one small source file, so it is easier to embed it.

However my main dependency was etheir to \gstreamer{} of to \ffmpeg/\avconv. Since
they are both as complex, it was not an arguments in favor of one or another.
-> more complicated remaining dependancy in my code.

In the optique of being as simple as possible for the user to test that sofware,
I had to design my sofware in a way it could be used without installation.
(\fpm{} was initialy used to create real .deb package)

\subsection{Build system}

I have developped a build system based on \cmake.

It was choosen because it is
cross plateform (that was obviously required), and powerfull enough to fit my
need. I also wrote a small python script to call \cmake{} more easyly. I have
developped it when I was trying to make cross compilation. So in one command, I
build the whole program for all architecture. XXX

cross-compillation
Our initial goal was to have a cross-plateform build system. In that ideal
scenario, when I want to create a new release of my software, I have

The build process for \linux, on intel and arm device or for \win{} is quite
similar (except some fiew \#ifdef), so the build system is the same (we use
\cmake). On \android{} however, The main has to be written in java. So, I have
used \jni{} to build my \cpp{} codebase and linked it to java. So I can share my
work also on that plateform.

\android{} ndk/sdk

\subsection{Grab image and send video}

\gstreamer{} pipeline
\ffmpeg/\avconv{} work similary.

\subsection{Mistakes}

I have wasted some time during my intership because at a point I was stuck, and
I had not enough method to find the right solution.

Making pair-programming was a good idea, but we did not use it enough for my
taste.

Sometime, when I was stuck, I left my desk, to help someone else, and when I
came back that person help me back. In general, that save us both a lot of time,
because, it help us to take a more global view on what we were doing. The key
point of that is that explaining to someone else our problem help us to
formalize it.

\chapterimage{Spider_web_necklace_with_pearls_of_dew.jpg}
\chapter{Results}

can compile and run on multiple plateforms~: all \linux{} (both intel and arm) and
\win. A lots of work have also be done for \android, but all the work have
not be finished.
The program I wrote still need more tuning to be really production ready.

\chapter{Conclusion}

The keys points of my intership was:
\begin{itemize}
\item design a sofware architecture
\item define witch protocoles will be used and how
\item create a robust build system
\item understand the link process
\item build for multiple target (\linux{} arm and intel, \win, \android)
\item try to have cross compilation
\end{itemize}

It was realy interesting, and now I have a better understanding of the link
process.

The part that motivate me the most was disigning the communication protocol.
When we disign a protocol, it have to be both expressive and easy to
parse/understand, so the result is something really clean.
